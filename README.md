## Project Overview

Earnwave is a web application built to closely replicate the UI and animation showcased in this [Dribbble design](https://dribbble.com/shots/22712725-AI-SaaS-landing-page-design). The goal was to match the visual style, layout, and interactive elements of the original concept as accurately as possible.

## Tech Stack

- **HTML**: Provides the structure and semantic layout of the site.
- **CSS**: Handles all styling, responsive design, and animations to mirror the Dribbble reference.
- **JavaScript**: Adds interactivity and dynamic UI behaviors.
- **[Line Awesome](https://icons8.com/line-awesome)**: Icon set included via CDN for scalable, modern icons.

## Live Demo

The site is deployed and available on Vercel:
